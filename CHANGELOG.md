## [Unreleased]

### Changed

* **Orphan rebuild (2026-05-20).** The crate was reset to a clean-room
  scaffold. The prior implementation contained module-level docstrings
  and inline comments whose provenance could not be defended against
  the workspace clean-room rule. Per the workspace's Implementer-Round
  procedure, such audit failures are unrecoverable via incremental
  cleanup and require an orphan rebuild.

  Every public API path now returns `Error::NotImplemented`. A
  clean-room re-implementation against RFC 9649 + RFC 6386 is planned
  for a future round.

  No `old` branch is retained; long-standing audit failures forfeit
  the archive per workspace policy.
